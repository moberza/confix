Changes
-------

The module description file format has changed, so it is necessary
that the user remove the files in ${prefix}/repo and re-bootstrap and
re-install all packages.

New features
------------

- Basic Libtool support.

- Dependency calculation speedup (roughly by a factor of 2).

- Major rewrite of the content/buildable relationship, to more easily
  accommodate new buildable types.

- Multiple config files are now accepted using the --configfile
  command line option.

- There are also new command line options for advanced users
  (--advanced) and for specifying the package version
  (--packageversion).

(See the ChangeLog file for detailed information.)

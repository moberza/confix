<h1>Confix: A Build Tool on Top of GNU Automake</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Build tools such as <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/">Automake</a>, <a
href="http://www.cmake.org">CMake</a>, or <a
href="http://www.scons.org">SCons</a>, try to shield the unfortunate C
or C++ programmer from crafting compiler and linker commandlines for
myriads of different compilers and compiler versions. Each of these
tools has a slightly different focus - some prefer cross-platform
features, and some focus on fully supporting all of the Unices. Each
is unbeatable in doing its job. Basically, all you have to tell them
is, for example, "Compile these files as C, and make a library out of
them!", and they do what you want.</p>

<p>Automake, CMake, and SCons do not, however, help you in managing
your project. All of us know that, once the project has grown beyond a
certain size, restructuring it can become a nightmare. Even moving one
header file can break the build for a day or two, since everybody has
to adjust include paths. Or, even worse, consider you split a library
into two or three separate libraries because it has acquired too many
responsibilities over time - you'd have to instruct everyone who has
used the library about the new structure. (People often argue that a
project's structure does not contribute any quality measure, and that
the time spent on the structure be better spent on getting the code
right. This is certainly a valid view of the matter, but it's a
different story, and I don't argue against. Anyway, if you do not care
about structure, then you should only be reading on if you want to use
the features of Automake but don't want to learn its damn syntax.)</p>

<p>Project structure maintenance is of course but one of Confix's
features, although the strongest. The following list is a rough
compilation of things that Confix can do for the programmer.</p>

<ul>

  <li><b>Automake input file generation</b>.

  <p>Automake is one of the most widely used build tools in the Unix
  Open Source community. Everybody who likes hanging around there
  knows the <code>configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make
  install</code> dance, the hallmark of Automake. But, as comfortable
  as it is for the end user who is in charge of compiling and
  installing a package, as odd it is for the maintainer of the
  package. Confix tries to take away the complexity from the build
  instructions, and defines it own minimal set of functions which are
  mapped onto the Automake language. (Actually, Confix project files
  are written in Python, so chances are you don't have to learn yet
  another language).</p> </li>

  <li><b>Automatic composition of the compilation's include path.</b>

  <p>Maintenance of the include path that has to be set when compiling
  source code is one of the great challenges in build
  administration. You have to take care that you point the compiler in
  every directory that contains header files needed for the
  compilation. This is often accomplished in a trial and error kind of
  way. More than that, one often faces the issue of leftover
  directories in the include path - ones that <i>did</i> contain
  needed header files way in the past, but which are either not needed
  for the compilation anymore, or which have been moved. Include paths
  tend to grow rather than shrink. Note that this include path problem
  is one of the reasons why project structures tend to become a maze -
  the cost of moving files around rises with the size of the
  project.</p>

  <p>Confix knows which compilation needs which header files (by
  simply parsing the files that are subject to compilation), and can
  match this information against the location where these headers
  are. This way, at the heart of its implementation, it maintains a
  graph which contains enough information to be able to compose a
  correct include path for every compilation - without requiring the
  programmer to do anything.</p>
  </li>

  <li><b>Automatic composition of linker command lines</b>.

  <p>Placing the libraries you need on the linker command line is a
  task which is at least as tedious as composing a correct include
  path. In addition to determining all the libraries that you need,
  you have to take care to place them on the linker command line in
  the correct order (most linkers are very particular about open
  references not pointing in the wrong direction). Needless to say
  that one would rather refrain from changing the library structure
  when he expects linker lines breaking and people getting
  annoyed.</p>

  <p>Confix solves this problem similar to the include path problem
  above. As it knows who needs what, it is not difficult to compose a
  correct linker line - again without demanding anything from the
  programmer (except to keep reference cycles out of his project, but
  this is a matter of hygiene anyway).</p>
  </li>

  <li><b>Independently maintained packages.</b>

  <p>For various reasons - project size, organizational, or simply
  taste (to foster good interfaces, for example) - it might make sense
  to split a big project into several smaller ones that are
  independently maintained. With Automake, the granularity of a
  project is the unit with which one does the <code>configure
  &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</code> dance. A project is
  finally made public by saying <code>make install</code>, and this is
  how project teams communicate changes: one team <i>installs</i> a
  tested version of their project (or releases it for installation),
  and the other team uses it.</p>

  <p>With Confix, you split a project by moving files, and nothing
  else (well almost).</p>
  </li>

  <li><b>Lots of other things.</b>

  <p>A lot of Confix's energy goes into fighting the overhead of
  project structure maintenance (you guessed it - I'm a fan). Here's a
  short summary of the other - minor - things it can do.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Location independent subdirectory installs.</b> You can
    make any header visible as <code>&lt;subdir/file.h&gt;</code>,
    without putting it into a directory <code>subdir</code>.</li>

    <li><b>Transparent inclusion of Autoconf checks.</b> If one
    project X includes an Autoconf check for some library, for
    example, another project that uses project X does not have to
    include this same check to make things work. This is done
    automatically by Confix. If you don't know what this means, then
    it doesn't matter.</li>

    <li><i>(To be continued.)</i></li>
  </ul>

<h2>Download and Installation</h2>

<p>You can download releases from the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/confix">project summary page at
Sourceforge</a>. The most recent stable release is 2.0. If no release
is recent enough, you may always checkout a <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=68975">development version
from Subversion</a>. You can also <a
href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/confix/">browse the Subversion
repository without having a Subversion client installed</a>.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions in the <a
href="http://confix.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/confix/confix/trunk/INSTALL?view=markup">INSTALL
file</a>.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>Umm, well. There is a bunch of it, but it has been extremely
outdated with the 2.0 release. It is a good reading if you want to
grasp the problems that Confix intends to solve, but it does not
explain the way Confix is <i>currently</i> trying to solve these
problems. (You can view the manual here as <a
href="confix.html">HTML</a> and <a href="confix.ps">Postscript</a>, if
you want.)</p>

<h2>Hacking</h2>

<p>The <a
href="http://confix.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/confix/confix/trunk/HACKING?view=markup">HACKING
file</a> gives an overview of what you're getting involved with. As
opposed to the documentation, the <a
href="epydoc/index.html">implementation documentation</a> reflects a
<i>current</i> state. It is automatically extracted from the source
using the extremely cool <a
href="http://epydoc.sourceforge.net">Epydoc</a>.
</p>

<h2>Mailing Lists</h2>

<p>There are <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=68975">three Confix
mailing lists on Sourceforge</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The announcements list, <a
      href="mailto:confix-announce@lists.sourceforge.net">confix-announce@lists.sourceforge.net</a>. Release

</ul>

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>Most of all I'd like to thank the handful of people that are using
Confix, and who continue to provide valuable input. Most of these
people are good ex-colleagues of mine.</p>

<p>I also express my thanks to my former employer, <a
href="http://www.salomon.at">Salomon Automation</a>, who made it
possible to go open source with Confix. I have spent a considerable
amount of working hours on it, and appreciate that it is not
selfunderstood for a company to take that step. At least, it pays in a
way that I am still maintaining the project after leaving the
company.</p>

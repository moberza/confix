<h1>Confix: A Build Tool on Top of GNU Automake</h1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>Confix does what is otherwise the job of the package maintainer:
write input files for <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/">Automake</a> and <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">Autoconf</a>. By
examining the package source, it determines how to shape
<code>configure.in</code> and the different <code>Makefile.am</code>
files in the package in order to perform a clean build.

<P>The main features of Confix include

<UL>

  <LI><I>Dependency calculation</I>. A correct build order of the
      package's modules is automatically determined. Furthermore,
      installed packages integrate into dependency calculation by
      means of a global "repository".
  </LI>

  <LI><I>Propagation of Autoconf checks between packages</I>. When one
      package uses another package, there often is the problem that
      the using package needs to apply the same Autoconf checks (or a
      subset thereof) that were applied when the other package was
      built. Not doing so can lead to subtle bugs; for example,
      disagreement about member offsets in structures. Confix tries to
      solve that problem by propagating checks into the using package.
  </LI>

  <LI><I>Mapping of C++ namespaces to include paths</I>. As Confix
      examines the source code, it can detect C++ namespaces, and map
      that hierarchy to the install location of the respective header
      files. (This feature can be suppressed though.)
  </LI>

  <LI><I>Interfaces for custom build instructions</I>. The plan is
      that a package maintainer need not write any build instructions
      at all, but to let Confix do that task by scanning the source
      code. However, should Confix need help from the maintainer, this
      can be done using a Python interface to modify build
      properties. One can place arbitrary Python code into source
      files, for example, or into dedicated configuration files.
      </LI>

<h2>Releases and Download</H2>

<p>You can download releases from the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/confix">project summary page at
Sourceforge</a>. The most recent stable release is 1.4. If no release
is recent enough, you may always checkout a <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=68975">development version
from CVS</a> (follow the instructions found on that page, substituting
<code>confix</code> for <code><i>modulename</i></code>). You can also
<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/confix">browse
the CVS repository without using CVS</a>.

<p>We have tried to define a numbering scheme for releases which may
help you decide if you should install a particular version. See <a
href="#numbers">below</a> for the numbers and more.

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>There is already a bunch of it, but, as always, there cannot be
enough for any project. The manual is written in <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/">Texinfo</a>, if it
matters, and is part of the packages and, of course, the CVS
repository. You can view the manual here as <a
href="confix.html">HTML</a> and <a href="confix.ps">Postscript</a>.

Developers might be interested in the <a
href="epydoc/index.html">implementation documentation</a> which is
automatically extracted from the source. This is done by the extremely
cool <a href="http://epydoc.sourceforge.net">Epydoc</a>.

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>So far, Confix is only available as a source package (which is
better than nothing though). Confix uses Python's <a
href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-distutils.html">Distutils</a>
for distribution and setup. If you're not already familiar, here's how
to do it.

<ul>
  <li>Unpack the file.<br>
<pre>
$ pwd
/home/jfasch
$ tar zxplf Confix-x.y.z.tar.gz
</pre></li>

  <li>Install the package using Distutils.<br>
<pre>
$ cd Confix-x.y.z
$ pwd
/home/jfasch/Confix-x.y.z
$ python setup.py install --prefix=${HOME}/sandbox
</pre></li>

  <li>Modify your environment accordingly. For example, given the above prefix,
  add the following to your <code>.bashrc</code>.<br>
<pre>
PREFIX=${HOME}/sandbox
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:${PREFIX}/lib/python2.2/site-packages
export PATH=${PATH}:${PREFIX}/bin
</pre></li>

</ul>

<p>You can find more detailed installation instructions in the <a
href="confix.html">documentation</a>.

<h2>Mailing Lists</h2>

<p>There are <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=68975">three Confix
mailing lists at Sourceforge</a>.

<ul>
  <li>The announcements list, <a
      href="mailto:confix-announce@lists.sourceforge.net">confix-announce@lists.sourceforge.net</a>. Release
      announcements and the like are posted
      there. (Un)subscribe <a
      href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/confix-announce">here</a>.
  </li>

  <li>The users list, <a
      href="mailto:confix-help@lists.sourceforge.net">confix-help@lists.sourceforge.net</a>. End
      user questions are answered there. (Un)subscribe <a
      href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/confix-help">here</a>.
  </li>

  <li>The developers list, <a
      href="mailto:confix-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">confix-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</a>. Developers
      communicate there. (Un)subscribe <a
      href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/confix-devel">here</a>.
  </li>

</ul>

<h2>Release Numbering, CVS</h2>

<p>We try not to roll dice when we release a new version, but adhere
to the following <a name="numbers">numbering scheme.</a>

<ul>
  <li>Release numbers are
      <code>&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;bugfix&gt;</code>.
  </li>

  <li>The <code>&lt;bugfix&gt;</code> version is incremented when
      there have been bug fixes from previous releases with the same
      <code>&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;</code> version. Of the three
      parts of the version, the bugfix part is supposed to change most
      often. It is considered safe to upgrade to a release that is
      only higher in its bugfix version as there are no differences in
      any generated files (except for differences that are the target
      of one particular bug fix, of course).
  </li>

  <li>The <code>&lt;minor&gt;</code> version is incremented with a
      release which contains significant new features, or when there
      <i>are</i> differences in generated files that make them
      incompatible with previous versions of Confix. The emphasis here
      is on the word <i>generated</i>, as a minor version increment
      does not require you to modify any source files. The most
      user-visible incompatibility will probably be that of the module
      description files. (See the documentation for what this is.)
  </li>

  <li>The <code>&lt;major&gt;</code> version is incremented when users
      are required to modify source code. You are encouraged to check
      the release notes of that release before you decide to switch.
  </li>

</ul>

<p>The connection between releases and CVS is as follows.

<ul>
  <li>Every release is tagged. The name of the release tag is
      <code>RELEASE-&lt;major&gt;_&lt;minor&gt;_&lt;bugfix&gt;</code>.
  </li>

  <li>New features and incompatible changes are developed on the main
      trunk, and this is where the release is made from. (What follows
      is that all zero-bugfix releases are made from the trunk.)
  </li>

  <li>Bugfixes to a zero-bugfix release make for a
      <i>bugfix branch</i>. That branch is rooted at the release tag
      of that release, and is named
      <code>RELEASE-&lt;major&gt;_&lt;minor&gt;_0-bugfix</code>. All
      bugfix releases to the &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt; release are
      done on that branch.
  </li>

</ul>

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>Most of all I'd like to thank the handful of people that are using
Confix, and who continue to provide valuable input. Most of these
people are good colleagues of mine.

<p>I also express my thanks to my employer, <a
href="http://www.salomon.at">Salomon Automation</a>, who made it
possible to go open source with Confix. I have spent a considerable
amount of working hours on it, and appreciate that it is not
selfunderstood for a company to take that step.

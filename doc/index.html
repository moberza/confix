<h1>Confix: A Build Tool on Top of GNU Automake</h1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>Confix does what is otherwise the job of the package maintainer:
write input files for <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/">Automake</a> and <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">Autoconf</a>. It tries to
comprehend the source code, and determines how to shape
<code>configure.ac</code> and the different <code>Makefile.am</code>
files in the package in order to perform a clean build.

<P>The main features of Confix include

<UL>

  <LI><I>Dependency calculation</I>. A correct build order of the
      package's directories is automatically determined. Furthermore,
      installed packages integrate into dependency calculation by
      means of a global "repository".  </LI>

  <LI><I>Propagation of Autoconf checks between packages</I>. When one
      package uses another package, there often is the problem that
      the using package needs to apply the same Autoconf checks (or a
      subset thereof) that were applied when the other package was
      built. Not doing so can lead to subtle bugs; for example,
      disagreement about member offsets in structures. Confix tries to
      solve that problem by propagating checks into the using package.
      </LI>

  <LI><I>Mapping of C++ namespaces to include paths</I>. As Confix
      examines the source code, it can detect C++ namespaces, and map
      that hierarchy to the install location of the respective header
      files. (This feature can be suppressed though.)
  </LI>

  <LI><I>Interfaces for custom build instructions</I>. The plan is
      that a package maintainer need not write any build instructions
      at all, but to let Confix do that task by comprehending the
      source code. However, should Confix need help from the
      maintainer, this can be done using a Python interface to modify
      build properties. One can place arbitrary Python code into
      source files, for example, or into dedicated configuration
      files.  </LI>

<h2>Download and Installation</H2>

<p>You can download releases from the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/confix">project summary page at
Sourceforge</a>. The most recent stable release is 2.0. If no release
is recent enough, you may always checkout a <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=68975">development version
from Subversion</a>. You can also <a
href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/confix/">browse the Subversion
repository without having a Subversion client installed</a>.

<p>Follow the instructions in the <a
href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/confix/confix/trunk/INSTALL">INSTALL
file</a>.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>Umm, well. There is a bunch of it, but this has been extremely
outdated with the 2.0 release. It is a good reading if you want to
grasp the problems that Confix intends to solve, but it does not
explain the way Confix is <i>currently</i> trying to solve these
problems. You can view the manual here as <a
href="confix.html">HTML</a> and <a href="confix.ps">Postscript</a>.

<p><b>Hacking</b>

<p>The <a
href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/confix/confix/trunk/HACKING">HACKING
file</a> gives an overview of what you're getting involved with.

As opposed to the documentation, the <a
href="epydoc/index.html">implementation documentation</a> reflects a
<i>current</i> state. It is automatically extracted from the source
using the extremely cool <a
href="http://epydoc.sourceforge.net">Epydoc</a>.

<h2>Mailing Lists</h2>

<p>There are <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=68975">three Confix
mailing lists at Sourceforge</a>.

<ul>
  <li>The announcements list, <a
      href="mailto:confix-announce@lists.sourceforge.net">confix-announce@lists.sourceforge.net</a>. Release
      announcements and the like are posted
      there. (Un)subscribe <a
      href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/confix-announce">here</a>.
  </li>

  <li>The users list, <a
      href="mailto:confix-help@lists.sourceforge.net">confix-help@lists.sourceforge.net</a>. End
      user questions are answered there. (Un)subscribe <a
      href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/confix-help">here</a>.
  </li>

  <li>The developers list, <a
      href="mailto:confix-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">confix-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</a>. Developers
      communicate there. (Un)subscribe <a
      href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/confix-devel">here</a>.
  </li>

</ul>

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>Most of all I'd like to thank the handful of people that are using
Confix, and who continue to provide valuable input. Most of these
people are good colleagues of mine.

<p>I also express my thanks to my employer, <a
href="http://www.salomon.at">Salomon Automation</a>, who made it
possible to go open source with Confix. I have spent a considerable
amount of working hours on it, and appreciate that it is not
selfunderstood for a company to take that step.

(Sourceforge News Item Text for 1.2)

Confix is a build tool for open source packages. It does what is
otherwise the job of the package maintainer: write input files for
Automake and Autoconf, with information it gathers from the source
code.

Release 1.2 is primarily a feature release, but of course contains
lots of bug fixes from earlier releases. The highlights are,

- Python/Confix code embedded in source files is evaluated to
  manipulate the build behavior.

- New interfaces to pass Makefile.am fragments through to the
  generated files.

- Confix generates code to optionally disable build in subdirectories
  (using the --disable-<modulename> option). Likewise, you can disable
  usage of installed packages (using the --without-<modulename>
  option).

See the release notes,
http://confix.sourceforge.net/RELEASE-1_2_0.txt, and the homepage,
http://confix.sf.net, for details.

Have fun,
Joerg

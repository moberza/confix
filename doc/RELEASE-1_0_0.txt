The Confix 1.0.0 Release is the first public release, so summarizing
the changes from previous versions is somewhat academic. However, a
handful of people already use it, and these are the intended
audience. Here we go.

- The interface of a module's Makefile.py has changed
  significantly. It should be easier to use now. Most of all, it is
  documented in the manual (which has become 50 pages). See "4.6 Using
  Third Party Libraries" and "B.3 The Module Makefile.py
  Interface". Makefile.py files which use the old interface won't
  compile anymore, so manual adjustment is necessary. This only
  concerns wrapper modules for third party libraries, so the impact
  isn't expected to be that deep.

  This change has led to an increment in the major version which is
  now 1. (The minor and bugfix versions have been reset to 0 which
  does not mean that there are no new features and bugfixes.)

- The interface of the package's Makefile.py has been defined and
  implemented. It only contains 2 functions, setting the package name
  and version, but that's a beginning.

- Several bugs were fixed. I had no formal track of these before, so
  excuse me if I cannot give a detailed list.

Have fun,
Joerg

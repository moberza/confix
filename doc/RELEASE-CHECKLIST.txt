Distributions
=============

Making distribution packages
----------------------------

Source distributions are generally the only kinds of releases made.

$ python setup.py sdist --force-manifest --formats=bztar,gztar

Other formats are unusual (who needs .zip?), but are nevertheless
supported by distutils.

$ python setup.py sdist --help-formats

Uploading packages
------------------

$ ftp upload.sourceforge.net
# Give username: anonymous, password: <email address>
$ bin
$ cd /incoming
$ put Confix-2.0.0.tar.bz2

Creating file releases
----------------------

On the project page, http://sourceforge.net/projects/confix, navigate
a bit to find the "File Releases" section (logging in helps a
lot). Once you have found it, follow the instructions and make your
release.

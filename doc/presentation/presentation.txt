- autoconf

  - skizze autoconf

  - configure.in

    m4 produces shell script. blah built in macros library, function,
    program availability

  - Makefile.in

    fill-in form for variables determined by configure

  - steps

    - maintainer writes configure.in, Makefile.in's

    - maintainer calls autoconf -> configure

    - maintainer packages release

    - user calls configure -> makefile.in's transformed into
      Makefile's

    - user calls make

  - missing: standard targets (install, clean, ...)

- automake

  - skizze automake

  - adds standard targets, plus a few support m4 macros.

  - Makefile.am
  
  - steps

    - maintainer writes configure.in, Makefile.am's

    - maintainer calls automake (and a few associated scripts) ->
      Makefile.am's transformed into Makefile.in's

    - maintainer calls autoconf -> configure

    - maintainer packages release, using the dist target

    - user as before

- still missing

  - inter-module (but package local) dependencies

    ... have to be done by the maintainer.

  - inter-package dependencies likewise.

    skizze packdep

  - pmm automatisms

- confix

  - steps

    - maintainer is hacking. marks directories to be included with
      Makefile.py.

    - maintainer calls confix.py --bootstrap: configure, Makefile.in's

    - maintainer packages release, using the dist target

    - user as always

  - require, provide: prerequisites for dependency resolving

    - C++: namespaces

      xxx example

    - python: import

    - java: ???

  - resolve

    - circle detection

    - sticks together requires and provides

      skizze provreq

    - package-local: ordering criterion for top level modules, basis
      for include path and link line computation

    - inter-package: ???  package-descriptions

  - Makefile.py

  - restrictions

    - namespaces: 1 local maximum per .h file

    - make dist (and friends): depth one directory hierarchy per
      package

  - example xxx

  - open issues

    - more languages

    - autoconf checks for things such as different ORB implementations

    - generated files

    - package-descriptions

    - library names: suggest libwx<package-name>-<module-name>.a; for
      example libwxutils-threads.a

    - package versions: compatibility issues etc (like linux shared
      library versions?)

    - bugs, ...

- thoughts

  - package granularity

  - standard install locations

    - packages

    - package descriptions

  - cvsintern

Synopsis
--------

 The Autoconf Macro Archive aims to provide a collection of
 reusable Autoconf_ macros as free software. The archive
 currently features more than 300 macros which perform
 portability tests ranging from compiler support for weird
 language extensions to automatic generation of
 sophisticated Automake_ rules. However, all these macros
 have been contributed by friendly supporters of the cause
 from all over the Internet; the archive really just
 collects and distributes them.

How To Contribute
-----------------

 You have written a macro and would like to share it? Great!
 Just write up a brief explanation how it can be used, send
 it off to <simons@cryp.to>, and wait for me to get back to
 you with either an report of success or lots of questions.

 If you feel like being particularly helpful, you can do me
 the favor and format the macro in the archive's internal
 markup before submitting it::

  dnl @synopsis AX_MY_MACRO(param1 [, param1])
  dnl
  dnl Describe what test the macro performs,
  dnl what the parameters do, and how the result
  dnl is used after that.
  dnl
  dnl Paragraphs are separated by an "dnl" line.
  dnl
  dnl   An indented line is a block quote.
  dnl   That's often nice for giving examples.
  dnl
  dnl @author Joe Doe <joe@example.org>
  dnl @version 2006-08-20
  dnl @license AllPermissive

  AC_DEFUN([AX_MY_MACRO],[
  ...
  ])

 Please submit *one file per macro*. If you have a family of
 macros that depend on each other, denote that by calling
 ``AC_REQUIRE``; then ``aclocal(1)`` will collect all of
 them automatically no matter over how many files they are
 spread.

 The comprehensive list of all keywords understood by the
 formatting engine is:

 ``@category keyword``

     The keyword may be any of ``Automake``, ``C``,
     ``CrossCompilation``, ``Cxx``, ``Fortran``,
     ``InstalledPackages``, ``Java``, ``LaTeX``, or
     ``Misc``. You can assign a macro into more than one
     category by specifying multiple ``@category`` lines::

      @category C
      @category Cxx

 ``@synopsis a line of free text``

     The synopsis line should provide the usual
     specification of the macro's arguments. If you think
     it's useful, you can provide more than one
     ``@synopsis``.

 ``@summary a line of free text``

     Give a one-sentence explanation of what the macro
     does. This short summary will be displayed on the
     generated index pages.

 ``@version yyyy-mm-dd``

     Every macro in the archive is versioned with the date
     of the its last modification. For most macros, that is
     the day of submission.

 ``@author My Name <my.address@example.net>``

     This tag accepts free text, actually, so you can write
     whatever you want, but it's good practice to use the
     common format shown above. Multiple ``@author`` lines
     are permitted.

 ``@license keyword``

     The keyword may be any of ``AllPermissive``, ``GPL2``,
     ``GPLWithACException``, or ``BSD``. The Free Software
     Foundation recommends_ the all-permissive license for
     Autoconf macros.

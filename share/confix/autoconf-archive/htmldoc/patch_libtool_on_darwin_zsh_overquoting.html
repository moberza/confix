   Description
  </h2>
  <div class="indent">
   <p>
    libtool 1.4.x has a bug on darwin where the "zsh" is installed as the
    bourne shell replacement. Of course, the zsh is called in a compatibility
    mode but there is a common problem with it, probably a bug of zsh. Newer
    darwin systems have a "bash" installed now, but the configure-default will
    be "zsh" in most systems still.
   </p>
   <p>
    The bug revelas itself as an overquoted statement in the libtool cmds-spec
    for sharedlib creation on testing for "module" builds. Later libtool has
    gone rid of it by simply removing the quotes at that point . Here we
    maintain the original style and simply remove the extra escape character,
    i.e. we look for "archive_cmds" and replace a sequence of
    triple-backslash-and-doublequote with single-backslash-and-doublequote.

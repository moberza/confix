   Synopsis
  </h2>
  <p class="indent" style="white-space:nowrap;">
   <code>AC_CHECK_CC_OPT(flag, cachevarname)</code>
  </p>
  <h2>
   Description
  </h2>
  <div class="indent">
   <p>
    AC_CHECK_CC_OPT(-fvomit-frame,vomitframe) would show a message as like
    "checking wether gcc accepts -fvomit-frame ... no" and sets the
    shell-variable $vomitframe to either "-fvomit-frame" or (in this case) just
    a simple "". In many cases you would then call
    AC_SUBST(_fvomit_frame_,$vomitframe) to create a substitution that could be
    fed as "CFLAGS = @_funsigned_char_@ @_fvomit_frame_@.
   </p>
   <p>
    In consequence this function is much more general than their specific
    counterparts like ac_cxx_rtti.m4 that will test for -fno-rtti
    -fno-exceptions.
   </p>
   <p>
    This macro will be obsolete in the very near future - there should be two
    macros AX_CFLAGS_OPTION and AX_CXXFLAGS_OPTION that will add directly to
    the CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS unless a ac_subst-variable was given. Remind me of
    doing so if I forget about writing it all up - to use $CC-cc directly in
    here instead of ac_compile macro is bad anyway.

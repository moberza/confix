   Description
  </h2>
  <div class="indent">
   <p>
    when $prefix and $exec_prefix are still set to NONE then set them to the
    usual default values - being based on $ac_default_prefix. - this macro can
    be AC_REQUIREd by other macros that need to compute values for installation
    directories. It has been observed that it was done wrong over and over
    again, so this is a bit more safe to do.
   </p>
   <p>
    remember - setting exec_prefix='${prefix}' needs you interpolate
    directories multiple times, it is not sufficient to just say
    MYVAR="${datadir}/putter" but you do have to run `eval` a few times, sth.
    like MYVAR=`eval "echo \"$MYVAR\""` done atleast two times.
   </p>
   <p>
    The implementation of this macro simply picks up the lines that would be
    run at the start of AC_OUTPUT anyway to set the prefix/exec_prefix
    defaults. Between AC_INIT and the first command to AC_REQUIRE this macro
    you can set the two variables to something explicit instead. Probably, any
    command to compute installation directories should be run _after_
    AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE

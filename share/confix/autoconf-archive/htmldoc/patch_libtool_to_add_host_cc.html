   Description
  </h2>
  <div class="indent">
   <p>
    The libtool 1.4.x processing (and patched 1.3.5) uses a little "impgen"
    tool to turn a "*.dll" into an import "*.lib" as it is needed for win32
    targets. However, this little tool is not shipped by binutils, it is not
    even a command option of dlltool or dllwrap. It happens to be a C source
    snippet implanted into the libtool sources - it gets written to ".libs",
    compiled into a binary on-the-fly, and executed right away on the "dll"
    file to create the import-lib (dll.a files in gcc-speak).
   </p>
   <p>
    This mode works fine for a native build within mingw or cygwin, but it does
    not work in cross-compile mode since CC is a crosscompiler - it will create
    an .exe file on a non-win32 system, and as a result an impgen.exe is
    created on-the-fly that can not be executed on-the-fly. Luckily, the actual
    libtool snippet uses HOST_CC to compile the sources which has a fallback to
    CC when the HOST_CC variable was not set.
   </p>
   <p>
    this ac-macro is trying to detect a valid HOST_CC which is not a
    cross-compiler. This is done by looking into the $PATH for a "cc" and the
    result is patched into libtool a HOST_CC, iow it adds another configured
    variable at the top of the libtool script.
   </p>
   <p>
    In discussions on the libtool mailinglist it occurred that later
    gcc/binutils generations are able to link with dlls directly, i.e. there is
    no import-lib needed anymore. The import-table is created within the linker
    itself (in-memory) and bound to the .exe/.dll currently in the making. The
    whole stuff of impgen exe and compiling it on-the-fly, well, it is
    superflouos then.
   </p>
   <p>
    Since mingw crosscompilers tend to be quite a fresh development it was
    agreed to remove the impgen stuff completly from libtool sources. Still
    however, this macro does not hurt since it does not patch impgen cmds but
    it just adds HOST_CC which might be useful in other cross-compiling cases
    as well. Therefore, you can leave it in for maximum compatibility and
    portability.

   Description
  </h2>
  <div class="indent">
   <p>
    Do a `grep "^[a-z]*_cmds=" libtool` - these are "subroutines" encoded by
    libtool.m4 into the generated libtool script. Since libtool assumes that
    there is no subroutine-facility in the shell invoked, these are not
    actually subroutines, but actually a "list of commands". This looks
    correct, but the command separator is not ";" - it is "~", the tilde
    character.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now, grep again, look for `grep 'IFS="~"' libtool` and see that libtool
    scripting uses a for-loop on the command-list, i.e for cmd in $some_cmds.
    This works correctly when the IFS was modified, where IFS stands for "input
    field separator" which is whitespace characters by default.
   </p>
   <p>
    The problem: I have some real-world filesystems where there are directories
    using "~" inside of them, to be more to the point, it is a change control
    management software that uses source repositories of the form
    "path/master/project~version/src" and libtool has the tendency to resolve
    any symlinks so that it will paste such path into the $_cmds script when it
    gets evaluated a number of times.
   </p>
   <p>
    This script is a workaround: I do not know why the ";" was not chosen as
    the IFS, perhaps it has some weird interactions in some shells since it is
    also the default record separator being one time bigger in context than the
    argument separator. I have made good success however with using "?" as the
    IFS, since there is no path-name that uses a question mark, and there is no
    _cmds ever around that uses "?" for some thing.
   </p>
   <p>
    Oh yes, there are some usages of "*" to match shell-wise at the output file
    of some tool, so that might have triggered the choice to not use "?" in the
    first place - but in real life it never occured that a _cmds script was
    created that has gone to use "?". And so, this ac-macro exchanges the
    s/~/?/g in configured _cmds variables and replaces all occurences of
    s/IFS="~"/IFS="?"/ - and it all works smooth now.

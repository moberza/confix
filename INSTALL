This file briefly describes how to install the Confix source
distribution. Confix distribution is done using the Python Distutils
package, so the following is just a short excerpt of the distutils
documentation :-)

Unpack the file; for example,

    $ pwd
    /home/jfasch
    $ tar jxf Confix-2.0.0.tar.bz2

Then make a call to Distutils to build and install the source.

    $ cd Confix-2.0.0
    $ pwd
    /home/jfasch/Confix-2.0.0
    $ python setup.py install --prefix=${HOME}/sandbox

Then, provided you gave a non-default prefix, you should update your
environment accordingly. For example, you could add the following
lines to your ~/.bashrc :

    PREFIX=${HOME}/sandbox
    export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:${PREFIX}/lib/pythonA.B/site-packages
    export PATH=${PATH}:${PREFIX}/bin

Make sure A.B corresponds to the version of Python that you use, such
as 2.4.

That's it, you're ready to use Confix. Try out the installation by calling up
the command line help :

    $ confix2.py --help

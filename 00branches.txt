This is our configuration management map. Be careful to only maintain
it in the trunk: it reflects all branches, tags, and whatnot, and
therefore it should be maintained outside of version control. At least
theoretically; in practice, we need to put it somewhere -- and that's
the trunk.

The nomenclature of CM artifacts is taken from the book "Pragmatic
Version Control Using Subversion" by Mike Mason, and it reads as
follows.

Release Branch            RB-<rel>

Release                   REL-<rel>

Bug fix branch            BUG-<track>

Pre-bug fix               PRE-<track>

Post-bug fix              POST-<track>

Developer experiments     TRY-<developer>-<short-desc>

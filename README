Confix is a build and maintenance tool for source code packages. It is
built on top of the standard open source tool Automake
(http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/). It relieves the package
maintainer from the burden of having to write complex build
instructions by hand. It inspects the package's source code, guesses
what's to be done and writes the build instructions for the
maintainer.

In doing so, it adds value to Automake by automatically tracking
inter-package dependencies, doing inter-package check propagation, and
so on.

Confix is distributed under the LGPL, see the file COPYING for
details. Its homepage is located at http://confix.sourceforge.net.
